# Project-2-Draft
This is the draft of my Project 2. My scientific question was: Do the amount and locations of cis-peptide bonds determine the structural differences between the 5mif and 5mii carboxyl esterase 2 proteins found in the black Perigord truffle (Tuber melanosporum)? and my scientific hypothesis was: If both 5mii and 5mif protein structures are aligned, then the amount and locations of their cis-peptide bonds between which amino acids can be determined and show if and how they contribue to the structural differences.
